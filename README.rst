``tools/backup.sh`` is a copy of shelltools_backup_.

Use ``install.sh`` to easily copy files to the machine, or copy them by hand.
In that case, back them up first (``install.sh`` does that for you).

See ``install.sh -h`` for more. Really, do it now :)

The install code here has been split from the "dotfiles" repo.
